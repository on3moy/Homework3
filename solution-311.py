Exercise 3.11 (Miles Per Gallon)
Drivers are concerned with the mileage obtained by their automobiles. 
One driver has kept track of several tankfuls of gasoline by recording miles driven and gallons used for each tankful.
Develop a sentinel-controlled-repitition script that prompt the user to input the miles driven and gallons used for each tankful.
The script should calculate and display the miles per gallon obtained for each tankful. 
After processing all input information, the script should calculate and display the combined miles per gallon obtained for all tankfulls (that is, total miles driven divided by total gallons used).
